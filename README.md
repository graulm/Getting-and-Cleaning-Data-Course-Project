# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project include following files:

**README.md**       : This doc.

**CodeBooks.md**    : It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

**run_analysis.R**  : It contains the R code to perform the data clean up and anlysis.

**HAR_df_mean_Table.txt** : This is hte tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This file is the tidy data set required by the project that shows the average of each feature for each Activity and each Subject.
   
The layout is as follows: Subject (1..30), Activity, and the "mean" for each of the feature. Follows is an example:
   
Subject ActivityDesc tBodyAcc-mean()-X tBodyAcc-mean()-Y ......
   
1 STANDING 0.265696920582133 -0.0182981725176081 -0.10784573454611 ......
   
2 STANDING 0.273113115788079 -0.0191323183174834 -0.115649958175497 .....



# Raw Data:

The raw data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It is available form the following URL:

A full descrition of the raw data can be found here:

# Steps to clean up the data:

1- Download the zip file with the raw data

2- Unzip the raw data onto the R working directory

3- Get the features and Activities Desciption 

4- Load the X and Y TEST files, select the features with the mean & stand dev, and assign feature names

5- Load the X and Y TRAIN files, select the features with the mean & stand dev, and assign feature names

6- Combine both TEST and TRAIN data frame into one data frame

7- Create the final tidy data set with the MEAN for each feature by Subject and Activity
